# My Dotfiles

This is a modified fork of Freek Van der Herten's dotfiles. [freekmurze/dotfiles](https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles).

It contains the installation of my tools and software, some handy aliases and functions. Backups of setting are done via [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap-script.

The bootstrap script can be run be cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

Feel free to create an issue on this repo if you have any questions about them.
